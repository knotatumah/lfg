            The over-all goal for this project was to familiarize myself with Angular and Bootstrap with other technologies in between. This included but not limited to Node.js, Slim, npm, bower, and composer.

            The subject of this project was a 'Looking For Group' website (LFG), a product that is usually aimed introducing people to others with similar goals or interests, whether it is completing a specific task in a video game or finding a similar age group. Inspirations such as <a href="http://destinylfg.com" target="_blank">destinylfg.com</a> and <a href="http://destinylfg.net" target="_blank">destinylfg.net</a> lead me to believe this would be a fun task to try for myself all the while learning some of the most important technologies in web development today.

            Beyond templating and routing I had the goal of a meaningful REST api. I had three main goals beyond the basic CRUD:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A dynamic list of systems</li>
            <li>System-exclusive games</li>
            <li>System-exclusive activities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This posed an interesting challenge since many games are on many systems but not all of them, perhaps more so in the schema to have that normalized database to avoid shortcuts that duplicate games and activities between systems. You will notice that each system will produce one common game and one unique game and the common game (Call of Duty) will show a unique activity depending on the system (or all activities when no system is selected.) This was a fun yet subtle feature I enjoyed implementing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end I feel I accomplished all of my goals and produced a solid piece that I am proud to display. I am confident that with a bit more polish, a brand and some extended features, that this could be a real-world product that could easily be extended and maintained.
